Create seperate sections in the html for the logo and intro (header)
Seperate section for the photo grid (main), I do not think I will need seperate sections 

I am still comtemplating using flexbox for the header section and grid for the photo gallery or just using grid primarily for both sections 
Must add a pic of Po 
Add some personal touches such as being able to click on the like/follow button and it changes color, obviously cant save the liked photo to a database yet so it will be removed on page reload
I like animations, maybe find a way to integrate without changing the layout too much, maybe a seperate page 
The hover before and after pseudo affects can be made to look very impressive, work on that 
Do some research on what Instagram looks like and the dimensions, how they choose to lay their site out for responsiveness

POA:

1: Initial set up - just boiler plate folders and files 

2: Initial set up of the html structure for the page 

3: Set up the grid for the photo gallery and try to make it look like the reference 

4: TBC
